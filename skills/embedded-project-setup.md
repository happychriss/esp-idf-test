# Embedded Project Setup

## On Load

When this file is read at session start:
1. Read `/workspace/requirements.md` — this is the root of the project: what is being built, which hardware, current status of each feature
2. Read all other `.md` files in `/workspace/skills/` — they are active skills for this project
3. Read all `.md` files in `/workspace/hardware/` — they contain confirmed board and component config

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when starting a new embedded firmware project or when dropping into an existing one that lacks conventions. It establishes the folder structure and working rules that keep hardware knowledge organised and reusable across sessions.

---

## 1. Folder Structure

Ensure these folders exist at the workspace root:

```
/workspace/
├── requirements.md  # ROOT — project type pointer + functional specification for all features
├── external-docs/   # Raw external material — datasheets, vendor docs, board wikis (read-only)
├── hardware/        # Curated driver notes — confirmed working config derived from docs + experiment
├── skills/          # Reusable Claude skills (this file lives here)
└── src/             # Firmware source projects
```

Create any missing folders. Do not create a README in `docs/` or `hardware/` — the files are self-describing.

---

## 2. Knowledge Flow

This is the rule for where hardware knowledge lives:

```
docs/            →    hardware/           →    memory.md
(vendor source)       (confirmed config)       (thin pointers only)
```

### external-docs/
- Drop zone for external material: PDFs, vendor markdown, wiki exports
- Never edit these files
- When the user adds a file here, analyse it and create or update the corresponding `hardware/` file

### hardware/
- One `.md` file per board or component (e.g. `waveshare-esp32s3-touch-lcd-1.9.md`)
- Contains: pin tables, confirmed driver config, experimentally validated quirks
- Structure each peripheral as:
  ```
  ## Peripheral Name — Chip (confirmed working)
  | Signal | GPIO | Notes |
  ...
  ### ESP-IDF Driver
  - confirmed config values
  ```
- **Write back here** whenever experimental work confirms or corrects a value (pin polarity, timing, flags, etc.)
- This is the single source of truth — not memory.md

### memory.md
- Stays concise: pointers to `hardware/` files + framework-level gotchas that aren't hardware facts
- Never duplicate detail that belongs in `hardware/`
- Format:
  ```
  ## Hardware: <Board Name>
  Full config → /workspace/hardware/<file>.md
  Key quirks: ...
  ```

---

## 3. Analysing a New Doc

When the user adds a file to `external-docs/`:

1. Read it fully
2. Extract: chip name, interface, pins, timing, any init sequence quirks
3. Create `hardware/<component>.md` with a pin table + known config
4. Mark unconfirmed values clearly: `# unconfirmed — from datasheet`
5. Tell the user what was captured and what needs experimental validation

---

## 4. ESP-IDF Build Conventions

### Environment
- ESP-IDF v5.4.1 at `/opt/esp/esp-idf`
- Activate: `source /opt/esp/esp-idf/export.sh`
- Target: `esp32s3`

### New Project Checklist
- [ ] `main/idf_component.yml` — declare registry dependencies
- [ ] `sdkconfig.defaults` — baseline Kconfig overrides (fonts, tick rate, etc.)
- [ ] `main/CMakeLists.txt` REQUIRES — use `log` not `esp_log`
- [ ] Clean before target change: `rm -rf build managed_components sdkconfig`

### Flashing
`idf.py flash` fails on USB-CDC — always use esptool with `--before=usb_reset`:
```bash
source /opt/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
python3 -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -p /dev/ttyESP -b 460800 \
  --before=usb_reset --after=hard_reset write_flash \
  --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect \
  0x0  build/bootloader/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin \
  0x10000 build/<project>.bin
```

### Serial Monitor
`idf.py monitor` unreliable on USB-CDC — use Python serial with DTR/RTS reset:
```python
import serial, time, sys
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyESP', 115200, timeout=1)
s.dtr = False; s.rts = True; time.sleep(0.1); s.rts = False
end = time.time() + 15
while time.time() < end:
    d = s.read(256)
    if d: sys.stdout.buffer.write(d); sys.stdout.flush()
s.close()
```

### LVGL 9 / esp_lvgl_port v2
See working reference project: `/workspace/src/hello_world`

Key gotchas:
- `lvgl_port_display_cfg_t.io_handle` is required — pass the SPI panel IO handle, not NULL
- Use LVGL 9 API: `lv_display_t*`, `lv_button_create()`, `lv_obj_remove_flag()`, `lv_display_get_screen_active(disp)`
- `flags.swap_bytes=true`, `flags.buff_dma=true` for SPI displays

---

## 5. Write-Back Rule

At the end of any session where hardware behaviour was confirmed experimentally:
1. Update the relevant `hardware/` file with the confirmed values
2. Trim any duplicate detail from `memory.md` — keep only the pointer and non-hardware gotchas
